# Server Side Vulnerabilities

This page is dedicated to a broad understanding of Server-side vulnerabilities. For details about specific vulnerabilities see the [Vulnerabilities](broken-reference) sub-group.

## Path traversal

Web apps use endpoints to guide the user towards specific information. When these endpoints are user controlled i.e. the parameters change because of user action, this functionality can be vulnerable to path traversal.&#x20;

The most basic path traversal vulnerability is when the web app does not sanitise any user input. For example, when a web app responds with a URL resembling something like this:

```url
http://example.com/page/?filename=about.php
```

If the user input is not sanitised, we can use path traversal to read sensitive files. The idea is that the `page.php` file is being hosted at `/var/www/html/page.php`. We can use this information to try and read the `/etc/passwd`.&#x20;

One of the simplest form of path traversal is the payload `../../../../etc/passwd`. The `../../../` changes the directory from `/var/www/html` to the root directory. An extra `../` can be added to make sure we are at the root directory even if the current file is being hosted inside further directories. Finally, we instruct the server to load `/etc/passwd`. If this traversal works, we can read any arbitrary file on the server.

The following GitHub repository contains a comprehensive list of payloads to be used when testing for a path traversal vulnerability. Even if the server sanitises some input, we can try to bypass them with encodings.
