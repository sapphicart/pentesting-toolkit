# Port 50051

## What is Port 50051

I came across this Port while working on a[ Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machine. This port was running a unique gRPC service. According to the official website, gRPC is a _"modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment."_ Basically, gRPC is a service connecting the backend to the frontend.&#x20;

## How does gRPC work

gRPC is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. An RPC framework sends the client's request to the server which then executes the request according to the specified parameters. gRPC connects multiple devices, both mobile applications and browsers, to the backend services.

Any backend service, if not implemented properly, can expose sensitive information about the server and the requests being executed.

## gRPC vulnerabilities

gRPC allows communication to happen in plaintext by default. If the `usePlaintext()` method is left open while building communication channels, an attacker can view sensitive information and inject malicious data. More information on this vulnerability is available below.
