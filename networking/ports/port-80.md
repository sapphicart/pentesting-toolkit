# Port 80

## What is port 80

Port 80 is used for network communications through Hypertext Transfer Protocols (HTTP). HTTP relies over the TCP. HTTP is mostly deemed insecure as it is a plaintext protocol, meaning the data sent over HTTP is in human-readable format and can be retrieved by anyone monitoring the connection. Thus, modern networking systems use the more secure version of HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS runs on [Port 443.](port-443.md)

Although HTTP is deemed insecure, the Port 80 is left open on most servers as it can help in redirection from HTTP to HTTPS. This phenomena can be tested in real time, visit a secure site by manually typing http:// and the page will automatically redirect to an HTTPS site.&#x20;

## How does HTTP work

The HTTP protocol running on Port 80 communicates over requests. The client side sends a GET request which is then answered by the server with a response code. Other request types are POST, PUT and DELETE.
