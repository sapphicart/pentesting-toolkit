# IP Addressing

IP Address is a unique identifier used by hosts on a particular network to communicate with each other as well as with other networks. The typical IPv4 address consists of 4 octets (32 bits) usually converted to decimal notation for human readability. On the other hand the IPv6 address is 128 bits in length and is represented by hexadecimal values.&#x20;

The IPv6 configuration was developed to configure unique addresses for all hosts as the  number of IPv4 addresses quickly depleted.

## IPv4 Addressing

A typical private IPv4 address could be `192.168.29.123`. This address is written in decimal notation. The actual 32 bits notation for the above address is `11000000.10101001.00011101.01111011`. The process of converting decimal notations to binary is fairly simple.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="113">Binary</th><th width="61" data-type="number">1</th><th width="64" data-type="number">1</th><th width="64" data-type="number">1</th><th width="61" data-type="number">1</th><th width="60" data-type="number">1</th><th width="61" data-type="number">1</th><th width="56" data-type="number">1</th><th width="57" data-type="number">1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Decimal</td><td>128</td><td>64</td><td>32</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

The binary notation `11111111` is 255 in decimal notation. This is the sum of all corresponding decimal numbers for the binary notation. (Try adding 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 and verify if the sum is 255) All binary to decimal calculations can be done using the above process. For example, the binary notation `00000011` will be 3 in decimal, `10000000` will be 128 and so on.&#x20;

Now, let's verify if the binary notation `01111011` is 123 in decimal.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="113">Binary</th><th width="54" data-type="number">0</th><th width="65" data-type="number">1</th><th width="64" data-type="number">1</th><th width="61" data-type="number">1</th><th width="56" data-type="number">1</th><th width="57" data-type="number">0</th><th width="56" data-type="number">1</th><th width="67" data-type="number">1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Decimal</td><td>0</td><td>64</td><td>32</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

The sum of 64, 32, 16, 8, 2 and 1 is indeed 123.

## Private vs Public IP Addresses

With the vast amount of hosts in use today, it is impossible to create a unique IPv4 address for every host. Private and Public IP addresses solve this problem by providing a generic IP addressing system for local networks. These IP addresses are not unique and it is possible that different local networks use the same IP range.&#x20;

How do we connect to devices outside the network then? This is made possible by NAT (Network Address Translation). The router that talks to the internet in a local network is configure to use NAT for translating private IP addresses to public IP addresses. The public IP addresses is assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider) and is not free to use.&#x20;

This categorisation of public and private makes it possible for unique IPv4 addressing as a local network can contain tens of private IP addresses but only one public IP address (the router using NAT configuration) is needed to connect to the internet.

| Private IP Range              | Public IP Range                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | _All IP Range not listed as public_ |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | _e.g. 17.5.8.7_                     |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 |                                     |

## Special IP Addresses

#### Loopback Address

The loopback address of the range (127.0.0.1 – 127.255.255.254) or simply 127.0.0.1 is used for the host to direct traffic to itself. The `ping` command can be used to check the network traffic of the host against itself.

#### Link-local Address

Link-local address ranges from 169.254.1.0 – 169.254.254.255 and is configured automatically by devices when they cannot contact the DHCP server for an IPv4 address configuration.

## IPv6 Addressing

As the number of unique IPv4 addresses depleted, IPv6 was introduced to increase the number of unique addresses. An IPv6 address is 128 bits in length and is represented by hexadecimal values.

An example of IPv6 address is: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`

To compress the address efficiently, two rules are applied:

* Remove all leading zeros
* Replace a string of continuous zeros with a double colon

After applying both these rules, the above address can be rewritten as `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`
