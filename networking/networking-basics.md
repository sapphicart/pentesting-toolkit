# Networking Basics

## Network Types

* **PAN:** Personal Area Network
  * Enables communication between devices around a person.
  * Bluetooth is common example
  * Can be wired or wireless
* **LAN:** Local Area Network
  * Limited to a small localized area such as a single building or site
  * Group of communications that connect to same server
  * Require cables, switches and routers
* **MAN:** Metropolitan Area Network
  * Spans an entire city sometimes
  * also known as CANs
  * organized by connecting multiple LANs
  * cable tv or telephone connections
* **WAN:** Wide Area Network
  * Extends over a large geographical area
  * Internet is an example
  * WLAN: Wireless LAN
  * Links two or more devices using wireless communication connects to internet with a gateway
* **VPN:** Virtual Private Network
  * establishes a private and secured network connection across public networks
  * encrypts internet traffic, secures data and disguises identity

## Topology

* Star
* Ring
* Tree
* Bus
* Mesh

## Wired Connections

* **Dial Up**
  * popular in the past, is mostly replaced my broadband connections
  * requires a modem and a phone line
  * is widely available
  * low cost, easy setup
  * very slow
  * cannot use phone and internet at the same time
* **DSL Digital Subscriber Line**
  * connects to internet with a modem and two copper wires within phone lines
  * slower than cable and wire but faster than dial up
  * uses existing phone lines
  * not always available
  * gets slow over long distances
* **Cable**
  * delivers internet via copper coaxial tv cable
  * high speed
  * better than DSL
  * bandwidth congestion
  * slower uploads
  * electromagnetic interference
* **Fiber Optics**
  * transmits data by sending pulses of light across strands of glass
  * fast, reliable and consistent
  * rarely lags
  * fast speed
  * expensive
  * not available everywhere

## Cables

* Hard Drive- SATA, SCIS
* Network- Coaxial, Fiber Optic, Twisted Ethernet
* Serial: USB,
* Video: HDMI, VGA
* Multi-purpose: USB, Lightening

## Unique Identifiers of Network

* **Hostname**
  * Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as "Hostname".
* **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**
  * Network address of the system across the network. (`ifconfig`)
* **MAC Address** Physical address, unique identifier of each host and is associated with the NIC aka Network Interface Card (`ifconfig -a ether`)
* **Port**
  * A logical channel through which data can be sent/received by an application.
  * Each application is identified through the port number on which it is running.
  * `netstat -a` lists all the ports being used.
* **Socket**
  * Unique combination of IP address and Port number together
* **DNS Server**
  * DNS Domain Name System
  * `nslookup` gives the IP Address of the domain
* **ARP**
  * Address Resolution Protocol
  * Convert an IP Address to its corresponding physical address
  * Used by the Data Link Layer to identify MAC Address of the receiving machine
* **RARP**
  * Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
  * Converts MAC address to IP
  * Has become obsolete since DHCP came into picture
* **Switches**
  * Acts as a controller to connect various devices to a network in a building or campus
  * Two types of Switches - On-Premises and Cloud-Managed
* **Routers**
  * Connects multiple networks together, also connects computer in a network to the internet
  * Acts as a dispatcher, analyses data being sent out choose the efficient route for the data to travel
  * Protect from security threats
  * Depending on the function, we can choose from a Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet Protocol (IP) or router with firewall

## IP and MAC Addresses:

See [IP Addressing](ip-addressing.md) for details

* `ifconfig -inet` (ipv4 address)
  * inet6 (ipv6 address)
  * NAT (Network Address Translation)
  * Private IP Addresses not used anywhere on public internet, reserved for LANs, can be seen with `ifconfig`
  * MAC (Media Access Control) Address the physical address of the device which communicates with switches, denoted as "`ether`" in `ifconfig`
  * Anything that uses a network interface will have a MAC address

## TCP and UDP (Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol) :

* TCP is connectivity protocol while UDP is connectionless
  * TCP is highly reliable used for websites, ssh, ftp etc.
  * UDP used for streaming, dns etc.
* TCP works with Three-Way Handshake
  * Three-Way Handshake:
    * send out SYN packet > receive SYN ACK packet > send ACK packet
    * the above packets can be used in various ports

## Common Ports and Protocols:

Protocol is a set of rules and algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network.

* **TCP**
  * **FTP File Transfer Protocol (21):** get or put a file on the server
  * **SSH (22):** similar to telnet, logs onto a remote server, is encrypted
  * **Telnet (23):** similar to ssh, logs onto a remote server, is in clear text
  * **SMTP (25):** related to mails
  * **DNS Domain Name System (53):** resolves an ip address to human readable domain name
  * **HTTP (80) / HTTPS (443):** used for web apps, HTTP is not encrypted and thus not secure HTTPS is encrypted and secure
  * **POP3 (110):** related to mails
  * **SMB (139 + 445):** related to file sharing, is exploited often during pentesting
  * **IMAP (143):** related to mails
* **UDP**
  * **DNS Domain Name System (53):** similar to the TCP DNS
  * **DHCP (67, 68):** assigns a random ip address when the device connects to the internet, also assigns a static ip address to a specific device based on the device's MAC address
  * **TFTP Trivial File Transfer Protocol (69):** similar to FTP but utilises UDP instead of TCP
  * **SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol (161):** will be seen ocassionally on networks but will probably have some important information when we do encounter it
